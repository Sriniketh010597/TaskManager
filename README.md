# TASK MANAGER (AN EMPLOYEE LOGIN PORTAL)

## Introduction and purpose

This project endeavors to develop an employee login platform tailored specifically for organizational environments. The primary objective is to elevate the efficiency and user experience of the portal catering to personnel across three distinct hierarchical tiers: Developers, Team Leads, and Product Managers. The project has been meticulously structured to achieve precision and simplicity in its implementation, employing Spring Boot as the framework for application development, and MySQL database for data storage. 

## Product Capabilities

This product prioritizes simplicity and user-friendliness, designed to accommodate organizations across all tiers. The user interface ensures seamless navigation and ease of use. Inline JavaScript mitigates data transmission, while CSS enhancements ensure compatibility with inline content. Furthermore, a password-protected database system safeguards employee data, prioritizing user and employee privacy.

## Software and Tools used

The primary software and tools essential for the project development encompass:

I. Eclipse IDE version 2022-03: Eclipse serves as the primary Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java programming. Eclipse IDE version 2022-03 was employed for this project.

II. Spring Boot: This tool facilitates the creation of self-running applications without external web servers.

III. MySQL Workbench 8.0: Utilized for employee database creation and management, MySQL Workbench 8.0 is integral to our server infrastructure.

The project development comprised two primary segments:

i. Front-end Development: HTML and CSS were utilized for the front-end interface.

ii. Back-end Development: Java and JavaScript were employed for implementing back-end functionality.

Apache Tomcat was deployed for server deployment, enabling Java Server Pages (JSP) execution within web applications, crucial for database creation and management.

## Technical Approach

Eclipse served as the primary development environment, integrating Spring Boot for web application development. MySQL Workbench 8.0 facilitated database creation and coordination with Eclipse programs.

The project design adhered to an Object-Oriented methodology, aimed at streamlining complexity and enhancing navigational ease. To address potential portal sluggishness during peak usage, Inline JavaScript and CSS optimization were employed. The design implementation followed a systematic, step-by-step approach.

At the developer level, the interface includes options for "Fetch Employee Details" and "Assigned Task." Team Leads gain access to additional tabs such as "Developer Level Associates," "Assign Task," and "Your Details," while Product Managers access tabs like "Developer Level Employees," "Team Lead Employees," "Task Creation," and "Task Summary."
